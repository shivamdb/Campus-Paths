# Campus-Paths
A web application for university students that helps in finding the route between any 2 buildings on UW campus and draws the shortest path on the map. Built the Front End using React and CSS. Used Spark Server that helped my application to query data from my java program.
Built a Graph ADT from scratch and found the shortest path using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. Tested my implementation using JUnit Tests and Script Tests
